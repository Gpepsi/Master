Developments concluded 16th of October, 2022
Final Ver # 7.0

OVERVIEW
The password manager code was designed to display a menu, in which the user is able to select options.
The options presented allow the user to create a new record that includes a username, password and website. Where the other options all the user to update the recorded username, password or website that has already been saved to a database.
There are also options to view the entirety of the stored database and txt file.
The code also records and updates a txt database through the options menu

The script allows the user to input commands by choosing options stated in the menu, and through prompts, instructs the user to input information where needed. 
If the user does enter an invalid option of duplicate information, the script will return appropriate responses to the reason for the error. 
Otherwise, if the information entered is unique and correct, the database will update with any new information added by the user.

In future iterations, a fully functional database could be upgraded to an SQL database, making the code more compact. It is also possible to install a new administrator password, so that information cannot be viewed or changed by unauthorized users.
Encryption is also a high priority for future iterations, so as to protect the contents of the database.
